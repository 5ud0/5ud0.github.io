Elm is having a lot of buzz lately because of it's great feature set like fast rendering [benchmark](http://evancz.github.io/todomvc-perf-comparison/),functional programming,crystal clear defining syntax and time travller debugger :thumbsup: .

<!--more-->

I cannot find much posts learning Elm other than the official docs.Although they are very good,I am more habituated to reading blogs rather than docs.I will edit this series as I let myself in to the Elm world and have some bulletpoints for myself and quick reference.

# Installing Elm :

Installing Elm is pretty simple,if you are on ubuntu,just run this command :

npm install -g elm

> You need to have Node and NPM installed.
Use sudo if the above one fails
{: .warnquote}

For now,I leave with this blogpost that I am learning ELM from. I will be sure to update the posts as I learn.
