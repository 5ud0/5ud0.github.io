title: Using Phoenix with Mongo
---


If youâ€™re brand new to Phoenix then I would suggest going through [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/).You can also read this [book](https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix/programming-phoenix) from Pragmatic Bookshelf.

That said,Phoenix added Mongo Ecto Adapter recently.I have not found any posts that are updated.This post is the most updated that I can found.

> If anyone finds one that is updated,post the link in comment :smile:
